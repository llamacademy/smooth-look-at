The below video is the tutorial that **ENDS** where this project is.

In this project we have:
1. A simple scene with 2 variants of how to "look at" a target.
2. LookAtTarget script - smoothly rotates an object to look at the specified trasnform
3. AlwaysLookAtTarget - the "simple" way to make a transform look at another target, updating in a single frame

## Requirements
* Requires Unity 2019.4 LTS or higher. Lower probably also works but is untested.
